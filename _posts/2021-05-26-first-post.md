# Come on in!

Hello there! Do come on in!

Don't mind the mess; I'm still unpacking and decorating the place! I'd offer coffee, but I can't find my coffee pot at the moment!

I want this site to be a place where I can share stuff I'm working on, teach others, maybe share some stuff I enjoy as well. It's gonna take a while as everything gets put together so it'll be a bit messy for a bit.

Here's some posts you can expect to see (in no particular order):

1. Linux related posts, ranging from tutorials to best practices
2. OpenBSD related posts, same as above
3. Plan 9/9front related posts, which may make one ask questions :P
4. Electronics posts
5. Cats
6. Photography
7. Fighting for human rights
8. Okay, this list is getting kinda long
9. Generally anything that strikes my fancy

Essentially, this is a blog, so whatever I feel like sharing or posting that may be too long for Twitter will go here.

For now, you can still see my Twitter posts [here](https://twitter.com/LambdaCalculus7).

Hope to see everyone soon, and remember:
